# Analysis of Dijkstra & Bellman-Ford
Part 1 of Final Project for CSCI3383 (Algorithms) at Boston College:
* Instructor: Lewis Tseng
* Semester: Fall 
* Team Members: Tia Lim, Jiacheng Xu

### Introduction
In class, we learned the Dijkstra's algorithm and Bellman-Ford algorithm to determine, given some graph and a starting node s, the shortest distances from s to all other nodes in G. While Dijkstra's algorithm has better time-complexity, it does not work when G contains negative edge-weights. Bellman-Ford has a higher time-complexity but is tolerant to negative edge-weights.
In this project, we will implement and study the performance of both algorithms.
